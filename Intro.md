Organic chemistry is a branch of chemistry that focuses on a single
element: carbon!  Carbon bonds strongly with other carbon atoms and with
other elements, forming numerous chain and ring structures.  As a
result, there are millions of distinct carbon compounds known and
classified.  The vast majority of the molecules that contain carbon are
considered organic molecules, with few debatable exceptions such as
carbon nanotubes, diamonds, carbonate ions, and carbon dioxide.  Carbon
is central to the existence of life as it is an essential component of
nucleic acids (DNA and RNA), sugars, lipids, and proteins.  A
well-rounded student of science must take courses in organic chemistry
to understand its application to various topics, such as the study of
polymers (plastics and other materials), hydrocarbons, pharmaceuticals,
molecular biology, biochemistry, and other life sciences. In the first
semester of organic chemistry, you will learn the basic concepts needed
to understand the three-dimensional structure of an organic molecule,
predict the reactivity of a given molecule (based on its chemical
structure), and recognize the mechanisms behind a chemical reaction. 
You will explore different explanations of how atoms bind in
carbon-based molecules and learn about the simplest carbon structures
(alkanes) before moving on to more complex carbon structures (alkenes
and alkynes) and their reactions.

### Learning Outcomes

Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to:  
  

-   Describe organic molecules in terms of bonding, stereochemistry,
    functional groups, and resonance.
-   Demonstrate proficiency in the nomenclature of organic molecules.
-   Derive the intermolecular force of given molecules based on their
    chemical structures.
-   Draw and represent organic molecules, using arrow notation to show
    the movement of electrons.
-   Demonstrate proficiency in identifying various classes of reactions
    (i.e. addition, elimination, arrangements).
-   Describe the thermodynamics of organic reactions using energy
    diagrams.
-   Analyze the stereochemistry of simple organic molecules and the
    stereochemical consequences of reactions.
-   Demonstrate proficiency in Newman projections and conformations of
    cyclohexanes.
-   Demonstrate proficiency in determining whether alkyl halides will
    undergo a substitution or elimination reaction for a given set of
    reaction conditions.
-   Describe the basic reaction mechanisms of alcohols.
-   Demonstrate proficiency in calculating the degree of unsaturation of
    molecules.
-   Describe the basic reaction mechanisms of alkenes and alkynes.
-   Explain the concept of chirality, optical activity, and
    stereoisomerism.
-   Explain the concept of a carbocation, which is an ion with a
    positively-charged carbon.
-   Rank different carbocations according to their stability and/or
    reactivity.
-   Explain the differences between SN1 and SN2 substitution reactions
    and between E1 and E2 eliminations reactions.
